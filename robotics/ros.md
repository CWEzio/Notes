# Environment setup

## setup `ros` environment in `fish` 
[This article](https://yodahuang.github.io/articles/How-to-let-ROS-play-happily-with-fish/) is a good source.

In short,
1. To bring up functionalities like `roscd` and `rosed`,
  ```
    source /opt/ros/noetic/share/rosbash/rosfish
  ```
2. Setup ros env
   ```
    bass source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
   ```
3. Setup catkin workspace env, source its `setup.bash` 
   ```
    bass source devel/setup.bash
   ```

## Install dependencies with `rosdep`
1. Initialize `rosdep` if you haven't done so:
    ```
    sudo rosdep init
    rosdep update
    ```
2. Navigate to your ros workspace:
   ```
   cd <path-to-your-workspace>
   ``` 
3. Install dependencies
    ```
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
    ```
    - `--from-paths src`: specifies the `src` directory of your workspace, where the packages are located. 
    - `--ignore-src`: prevent reinstalling dependencies that has been already installed.
    - `-r`: recursively resolve dependencies
    - `-y`: confirm installation

# Problems 
## Unsorted

### program stuck at waiting for message
The cause of this problem is that I forget to initialize the node before communication.

### `rospy.init_node` will disrupt python logging
This is an old bug (check [this issue](https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/1384)) that hasn't been fixed yet. `rospy` disrupts python's logging, making all other modules' loggers and the root logger unable to work. 

To solve this problem, initialize node with the function below 
```python
def init_ros_node(node_name):
    """
    helper function to initialize the node without disrupting logging
    """
    existing_handlers = logging.root.handlers[:]
    rospy.init_node(node_name, anonymous=True)  # this will override current logging handlers
    logging.root.handlers = existing_handlers
    # Suppress unnecessary rospy logs by setting their log level to WARNING
    rospy_logger = logging.getLogger('rospy')
    rospy_logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)
    # Disable propagation to prevent duplicate log messages
    rosout_logger = logging.getLogger('rosout')
    rosout_logger.propagate = False
```

### No module named `python3-empy`
It turns out that the problem is not that I do not have installed `python3-empy`, it is that I mistakenly run `catkin-make` with my python virtual environment. I need to remove the previous build cache first:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws  
unlink src/CMakeLists.txt
trash build
trash devel
trash .catkin_workspace
```
and then run `catkin_make`.


### `rosrun` cannot find my python script
It turns out that rosrun can automatic detect executable files. However, at first I need to make the script executable by `chmod +x` and add 
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```
on the first line of the python script.


### Cannot open a node in a seperate terminal
I would like to open a node in a seperate terminal and thus I use 
```xml
  <node name="teleop" pkg="turtlebot3_teleop" type="turtlebot3_teleop_key" output="screen" launch-prefix="xterm -e" />
```
However, I encounter

```
RLException: Roslaunch got a 'No such file or directory' error while attempting to run:

xterm -e /opt/ros/noetic/lib/turtlebot3_teleop/turtlebot3_teleop_key __name:=teleop __log:=/home/chenwang/.ros/log/75148da4-dfee-11ec-896f-1372cd24759d/evader-teleop-6.log

Please make sure that all the executables in this command exist and have
executable permission. This is often caused by a bad launch-prefix.
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
```

**Solution**
It turns out that the error message is misleading. I got this error because I haven't have `xterm` installed. After installing `xterm`, everything works fine again.

## `fish`
### Autocomplete error in fish
When autocomplete the ros command in `fish`, I encountered this problem:
```
string split: -type f -perm /111: unknown option

/opt/ros/noetic/share/rosbash/rosfish (line 1):
string split --max 1 --right / $argv[1]
^
in command substitution
        called on line 578 of file /opt/ros/noetic/share/rosbash/rosfish
in function '_roscomplete_search_dir' with arguments '-type\ f\ -perm\ /111'
        called on line 648 of file /opt/ros/noetic/share/rosbash/rosfish
in function '_roscomplete_rosrun'
in command substitution
```

It turns out that the issue is caused by a bug in the `rosfish` file. To fix it, modify:
```fish
set path (string split --max 1 --right / $argv[1])[1]
```
in line 578 to
```
set path (string split --max 1 --right / $arg)[1]
```

### Symbolic lookup error

## using python virtual environment

### `symbol not found` issue
- Ref: [this csdn notes](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_38606680/article/details/129118491)

I encounter the following issue when using `cv_bridge` in a `python3.10` conda environment.
```
ImportError: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libp11-kit.so.0: undefined symbol: ffi_type_pointer, version LIBFFI_BASE_7.0
```

The cause of this issue is that I am using a new python version and it installs new packages. However, the ros package is old, which cause version conflicts.

In this case, it is caused by the `libffi` python package, which create a `libffi.7.so` to `libffi.8.so`.

The solution is:

1. 
    ```
    cd ~/miniconda3/envs/<env-name>/lib
    ```
2. Check the lib with error
    ```
    ls -l | grep ffi
    ```
    You would see `libffi.7.so` is linked to version 8 (or alike).

3. Delete `libffi.7.so libffi.so.7`  

4. Create new link
    ```
    sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.7 libffi.7.so
    sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.7 libffi.so.7
    ```
