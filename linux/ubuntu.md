# Usages
## Use file explorer to check the files on ssh server
Open file explorer → In connect to sever, type `ssh://<remote-address>` 

## File explorer bookmark
I can drag a folder/file to the left column to add it into the bookmark.

## Move window to other workspace
- `win + shift + pageup/pagedown` 
- My notebook keyboard does not have `pageup/pagedown` key. I need to press `win + shift` first and then press `fn + up/down` to move the window.
